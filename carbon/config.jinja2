 On some systems it is desirable for whisper to write synchronously.
 Set this option to True if you'd like to try this. Basically it will

{#-
 By default new Whisper files are created pre-allocated with the data region
 filled with zeros to prevent fragmentation and speed up contiguous reads and
 writes (which are common). Enabling this option will cause Whisper to create
 the file sparsely instead. Enabling this option may allow a large increase of
 MAX_CREATES_PER_MINUTE but may have longer term performance implications
 depending on the underlying storage configuration.

 By default new Whisper files are created pre-allocated with the data region
 filled with zeros to prevent fragmentation and speed up contiguous reads and
 writes (which are common). Enabling this option will cause Whisper to create
 fallocate the file instead. Only beneficial on a filesystem that
 supports fallocate.  It maintains the benefits of contiguous reads/writes.
 but with a much faster creation speed. Enabling this option may
 allow a large increase of MAX_CREATES_PER_MINUTE.
#}
WHISPER_FALLOCATE_CREATE = True

{#-
 Enabling this option will cause Whisper to lock each Whisper file it writes
 to with an exclusive lock (LOCK_EX, see: man 2 flock). This is useful when
 multiple carbon-cache daemons are writing to the same files

 The manhole interface allows you to SSH into the carbon daemon
 and get a python interpreter. BE CAREFUL WITH THIS! If you do
 something like time.sleep() in the interpreter, the whole process
 will sleep! This is *extremely* helpful in debugging, assuming
 you are familiar with the code. If you are not, please don't
 mess with this, you are asking for trouble :)

 This is a list of carbon daemons we will send any relayed or
 generated metrics to. The default provided would send to a single
 carbon-cache instance on the default port. However if you
 use multiple carbon-cache instances then it would look like this:

 DESTINATIONS = 127.0.0.1:2004:a, 127.0.0.1:2104:b (Should use only local instances)

 The general form is IP:PORT:INSTANCE where the :INSTANCE part is
 optional and refers to the "None" instance if omitted.

 Note that if the destinations are all carbon-caches then this should
 exactly match the webapp's CARBONLINK_HOSTS setting in terms of
 instances listed (order matters!).

 If using RELAY_METHOD = rules, all destinations used in relay-rules.conf
 must be defined in this list
