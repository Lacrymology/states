{#-
 If SYNC_DOWNLOAD is enabled then the value specified for this option limits the
 downloaded data to this resiliency period or greater.
 Resiliency is defined as the timespan between a hackers first known attack and
 its most recent attack.  Example:
 If the centralized denyhosts.net server records an attack at 2 PM and then
 again at 5 PM, specifying a SYNC_DOWNLOAD_RESILIENCY = 4h will not download
 this ip address.
 However, if the attacker is recorded again at 6:15 PM then the ip address will
 be downloaded by your DenyHosts instance.
 This value is used in conjunction with the SYNC_DOWNLOAD_THRESHOLD
 and only hosts that satisfy both values will be downloaded.
