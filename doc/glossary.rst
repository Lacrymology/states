their most common tasks. UNIX systems have built-in security features. Most
users cannot set up a new user account nor do other administrative procedures.
The user “root” is a special user, something called super-user, which can do
anything at all on the system. This high degree power is necessary to fully
administer a UNIX system, but it also allows its user to make a mistake and
cause system problems.

others (relying parties) to rely upon signatures or on assertions made by the
private key that corresponds to the certified public key. In this model of
trust relationships, a CA is a trusted third party – trusted both by the
subject (owner) of the certificate and by the party relying upon the
certificate.

C
~

C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting
structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static
type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides
constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore
it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in
assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application
software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.
