OpenVPN
=======

:doc:`index` is an open-source software application that implements virtual
private network (:ref:`glossary-VPN`) techniques for creating secure
point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations
and remote access facilities. It uses a custom security protocol that utilizes
:doc:`/ssl/doc/index`/TLS for key exchange. It is capable of traversing network
address translators (:ref:`glossary-NAT`) and firewalls. It was written by
James Yonan and is published under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
