Python

Homepage: https://www.python.org/

Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming
language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and
its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than
would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language
provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large
scale.
